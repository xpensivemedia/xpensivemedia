## 🔑 Firebase & Supabase Configuration
### Firebase Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add a web app and copy the Firebase config object.
3. Create a `.env` file or update `src/firebase.js`:
   ```js
   // src/firebase.js
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export default app;
   ```
4. Replace placeholders with your actual Firebase credentials.

### Supabase Setup
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. Copy your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` from Project Settings > API.
3. Create a `.env` file or update `src/supabase.js`:
   ```js
   // src/supabase.js
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
   const supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
   const supabaseKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY";
   export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
   ```
4. Replace placeholders with your actual Supabase credentials.

### Adding Videos (Carousel)
The main video carousels/grids are driven by `src/constants/portfolioVideos.js`.

1. Add the video file using one of these options:
   - **Supabase (recommended for large videos):** upload to Storage bucket `portfolio-videos` (public), then set `path: 'your-file.mp4'`.
   - **Local file:** put the file in `public/videos/` and set `path: '/videos/your-file.mp4'`.
2. Add an entry to `videoSlides[0].cards` (carousel).
3. Ensure `category` matches a key in `videoCategories`.
